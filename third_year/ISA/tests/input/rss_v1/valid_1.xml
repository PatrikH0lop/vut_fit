    <title>CVE-2008-5361 (air, flash_player)</title>
    <link>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-5361</link>
    <description>The ActionScript 2 virtual machine in Adobe Flash Player 10.x before 10.0.12.36 and 9.x before 9.0.151.0, and Adobe AIR before 1.5, does not verify a member element's size when performing (1) DefineConstantPool, (2) ActionJump, (3) ActionPush, (4) ActionTry, and unspecified other actions, which allows remote attackers to read sensitive data from process memory via a crafted PDF file.</description>
